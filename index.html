            AAS in Mobile Design and Development</h2>
        <div class="close">
            <p>The Mobile Design and Development Program is designed to train students to design and develop mobile applications. Students develop a comprehensive understanding of core design principles and key development strategies, including developing for both the Android and iOS (Apple) mobile devices. Students also gain a basic understanding of database technology used for providing data for apps.</p>

            <p>The program trains individuals to become mobile developers. Students learn design theory as well as gain experience in programming for multiple mobile platforms. The training is geared toward students with no experience, but is an excellent opportunity for people changing careers or who wish to take individual courses to stay current in their existing jobs.</p>

            <p>The primary purpose of an Associate in Applied Science degree is to prepare students for employment. The AAS degree is not designed specifically for transfer; however, there are opportunities to apply some coursework or the whole degree to a bachelorâ€™s degree program. For more information, see an academic advisor and the department chair.</p>
